# ytb-dl
### What is this?
This is a simple application that adds a UI to the existing ytdl-org project intended for use by people who are uncomfortable with the command line. It will never be as powerful as the command line tool but should allow for simple functionality.  

### Requirements:  
* Install [ytb-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)  
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
